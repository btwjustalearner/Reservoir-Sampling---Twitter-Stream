# Reservoir-Sampling---Twitter-Stream

I use Twitter API of streaming to implement the fixed size sampling method (Reservoir Sampling Algorithm) and find popular tags on tweets based on the samples. In this task, we assume that the memory can only save 100 tweets, so we need to use the fixed size sampling method to only keep part of the tweets as a sample in the streaming. When the streaming of the Twitter coming, for the first 100 tweets, you can directly save them in a list. After that, for the nth twitter, you will keep the nth tweet with the probability of 100/n, otherwise discard it. If you keep the nth tweet, you need to randomly pick one in the list to be replaced. If the coming tweet has no tag, you can directly ignore it. You also need to keep a global variable representing the sequence number of the tweet. If the coming tweet has no tag, the sequence number will not increase, otherwise the sequence number increases by one. Every time you receive a new tweet, you need to find the tags in the sample list with the top 3 frequencies.
